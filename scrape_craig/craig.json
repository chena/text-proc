I would like to offer my room in Sunnyside, Queens from September 2014-March 2015 (I am flexible with dates if you you'd like to move in sooner or a little later). You could resign the lease after this if you ended up liking it there too! You would also have one female roommate who is very down to earth, clean and quiet. Rent is $1,095 + utilities (which is about an extra $35). There is laundry in the building and the kitchen and bathroom has been recently renovated with all new appliances including granite counter tops. There is a dishwasher as well and lots of closet space! If for some reason you would like two rooms for you and someone you'd like to live with my roommate would be willing to look for an apartment herself.  This apartment would be perfect for students as there are students who live above us. Additionally, the commute into Manhattan is quite easy. You can just hop on the 7 and get into midtown in 15-20 min! Sunnyside is also a very nice little neighborhood with easy access to the subway, grocery stores, restaurants, bars and the pharmacy (all within a 3-4 min walk). Personally, I believe the best part of Sunnyside is how quiet it is (perfect for studying and of course sleeping)!  Last but not least I would be willing to leave you a furnished room with a bed, 2 dressers, and hangers. As well as kitchen supplies with a set of 12 plates/bowls, pots and pans, glasses and silverware. (We can negotiate the prices for these items later, some items I am willing to give for free).  Please shoot me an email if you are interested or would like pictures. Thank you.", "title": "$1095 / 2br - 1 bedroom available, new kitchen appliances, bedroom is furnished!"},

This posting is for a LARGE furnished bedroom in a luxurious apartment complex on the Hudson waterfront (please google: \"liberty towers jersey city\" for details on building). The unit has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. You would have your own room and share the bathroom with one other person. The rooms have large windows that feature STUNNING views of the NYC skyline.

The building has great amenities, including a large fully-equipped 24 hr gym, swimming pool (open in the summer), business center (free fax, printing, surfing etc), large study lounge, private washer / dryer in each apartment.  Location / Commute: this is the building literally right next to the Goldman Sachs towers; it is less than 2 blocks from the Exchange Place PATH subway. It takes 4 minutes to get to the World Trade Center / Wall Street area in Downtown Manhattan. And the commute to midtown (34th street) is ~25mins. Essex Street Lightrail stop is literally right in front of the building.  Neighborhood: we have a convenience store within the building itself, and several bars and restaurants within a 1 block radius.
