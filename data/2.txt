Kaohsiung, Aug. 1 (CNA) Gas leaks in the sewage system of Kaohsiung's Cianjhen District led to multiple explosions late Thursday night, injuring several people and overturning cars, according to fire department of the southern municipality.

Fire fighters, including those from nearby Tainan City, have rushed to the scene, and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu was urging people to leave the dangerous spots.

Witnesses said the gas leaks which began at around 9:00 p.m. formed white fog while fire was lighted up, leading to big explosions on several streets.

A witness surnamed Liu said at first he thought some "poisonous gas" had leaked from the old railway and a construction site of Kaohsiung's light rapid transit system.

"I saw fire spurting, ripping off some covers of ditches. It was terrifying," he said.

The explosions on Kaisuan Road and Ersheng Road rocked Cianjhen, Lingya, Siaogang and Cianjin districts.
